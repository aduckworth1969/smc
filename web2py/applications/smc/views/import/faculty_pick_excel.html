We just need the first five columns at the begining and in that order.</li>            <li><b>Disabling Faculty Accounts - Row full of *** </b>-  All faculty you put under this row will be DISABLED!! This is for turning off accounts for faculty who have left.</li>            <li><b>DO NOT</b> set an Excel password. We don't support passworded documents at this time</li>            <li><b>Import Classes Vs. Classes</b> - The Import Classes field is where you list classes faculty should be made teachers of.
